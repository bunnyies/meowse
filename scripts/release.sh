# Set NOTES_FILE to a Markdown file to use as the release notes (shown in the
# in-app updater); otherwise GitHub generates them.

# Releases must be signed with the same team as the installed app, or the
# updater refuses them. Downloads must also be signed with a Developer ID
# certificate and notarized, or Gatekeeper blocks them. Notarization uses the
# notarytool keychain profile in NOTARY_PROFILE (default "meowse"), created once with
#   xcrun notarytool store-credentials meowse
